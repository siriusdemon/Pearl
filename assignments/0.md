Assignment
Place all of your code in a file named a0.rkt, and submit it via Canvas. Please make sure your file has exactly this filename, and that it runs, before submitting.

1. Install racket on your PC/Laptop using the resources.

2. Define a variable pie as 3.14

3. Define a function to calculate the area of the circle given radius.

```racket
> (area_circle 5)
78.5
```

4. Define a function that returns the area and circumference of the circle as a list given radius.

```racket
> (circle_properties 5)
'(78.5 31.4)
```

5. Define a procedure that takes a list containing length and breadth of a rectangle and returns a list of area and perimeter.

```racket
> (rectangle_properties '(2 4))
'(8 12)
```
6. Define a function find-needle that finds the index of 'needle given the list of length 3 which contain the symbols 'needle or 'hay

```racket
> (find-needle '(hay needle hay))
1
> (find-needle '(hay hay hay))
-1
```

7. Define a procedure that takes a number and returns absolute value.
```racket
> (abs 3)
3
> (abs -2)
2
```
8. Use the built-in function map to increment the elements of the list by 1. Example given '(1 2 3) return '(2 3 4)

9. Define a function even that when passed to map along with the list of numbers returns a list of #t #f.

```racket
> (map even '(1 2 3 4 5 6))
'(#f #t #f #t #f #t)
```
10. Use let to bind the let name to the natural recursion part of the add function.

```racket
(define add 
  (Î» (n m)
    (cond
      [(zero? m) n]
      [else (add1 (add n (sub1 m)))])))
```
11. Define another-add that is naturally recursive but quits when the first argument is 0 instead of the second argument
