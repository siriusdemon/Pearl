# Assignment 8: Registerization and Trampolining

### Note
This assignment is going to be a relatively easy one since you also have to prepare for your mid-term exam in the week this assignment is due.

Answer the questions which mention briefly describe as racket comment (roughly in a paragraph or two) in your .rkt file

### Assignment
1. Consider the following definition of fibonacci. Briefly describe about the style used/ what is unique about this program when compared to the regular definition of fibonacci.

Registerize fib-cps function
Give the correct invocation of fib-cps function that would return 8:
```racket
(define apply-k
  (λ (k v)
    (match k
      [`(make-inner-fib-k ,fib-sub1-n^ ,k^) (let* ([k k^]
                                                   [v (+ fib-sub1-n^ v)])
                                              (apply-k k v))]
      [`(make-outer-fib-k ,n^ ,k^) (let* ([k (make-inner-fib-k v k^)]
                                          [n (sub1 (sub1 n^))])
                                     (fib-cps n k))]
      [`(init-k) v])))
 
 
(define make-inner-fib-k
  (λ (fib-sub1-n^ k^)
    `(make-inner-fib-k ,fib-sub1-n^ ,k^)))
 
 
(define make-outer-fib-k
  (λ (n^ k^)
    `(make-outer-fib-k ,n^ ,k^)))
 
(define init-k
  (λ ()
    `(init-k)))
 
(define fib-cps
  (λ (n k)
    (cond
      [(zero? n) (let* ([k k]
                        [v 1])
                   (apply-k k v))]
      [(zero? (sub1 n)) (let* ([k k]
                               [v 1])
                          (apply-k k 1))]
      [else (let* ([k (make-outer-fib-k n k)]
                   [n (sub1 n)])
              (fib-cps n k))])))
```

2. Make the following program Representation independent with respect to continuations, Use data-structure representation of continuations and trampolinize your program.

Run two different invocations of your function in bi-trampoline (available in class notes)
```racket
(define times-cps
  (λ (ls k)
    (cond
      [(null? ls) (k 1)]
      [(zero? (car ls)) (k 0)]
      [else (times-cps (cdr ls) (λ (times-cdr) (k (* (car ls) times-cdr))))])))
```
